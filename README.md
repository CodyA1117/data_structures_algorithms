# data_structures_algorithms
C++, data structures and algorithms.

Im Cody Adams, and here are a two projects that build off of each other. In our course we focused on data structures, and algorithms.  This readme provides some of the things that I worked on, challenges faced, and solutions to the challenges.

The main problem I faced with these projects was to create something that could effectively manipulate the course data located within a csv file. I approached the problem with different data structures such as vectors, hashtables, and binary search trees.  I tested the quality of each through using Big O analysis.  I found that the hashtable approach was the best for this perticular project.

To overcome getting the correct data was loaded from the csv file, I created pseudocode to help map out my approach. I also used debugging, and verious online platforms to figure out how to overcome these challenges. 

I think working on these projects helped me gain more knowledge about data structures and algorithms, and how to implement them into code, to execute different tasks. This also helped me gain practice on writing clearer code, and code that was easily readable, and had notes. I tried to make my code modular, and robust.  This should make it more easily maintained and updated.
